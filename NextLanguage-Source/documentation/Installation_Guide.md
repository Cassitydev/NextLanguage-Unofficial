## Installation Tutorial
How to install this language? Well, let me walk you through it.

**Recommended Setup**<br>
For our recommendation if you're just starting out to code and found your way to our coding language, we recommend you install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to help you start your coding jounery. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a free coding software that has many features to help and guide your coding jounery.

We're currently working on releasing our own vscode extension for this very Language. So when that releases check on our [Twitter](https://x.com/NxiumUpdates) for updates.

## How to install NextLanguage

**Step 1**: Download the latest version of NextLanguage from [here](https://github.com/Nxium-Developments/NextLanguage/releases/latest)<br><br>
**Step 2**: Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) and [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) installed. If you just installed NodeJS, don't worry there is an option for you to install NPM along with NodeJS as NPM doesn't have an official download link.<br><br>
**Step 3**: Once you have both the latest release of [NextLanguage](https://github.com/Nxium-Developments/NextLanguage) downloaded and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) is now installed, extract the archive and open the `NextLanguage` folder.<br><br>
**Step 4**: Run `npm run build` to install and build your NextLanguage Project.<br>

Once running `npm run build` it should automatically run the project, but if you want to start the project that has already been bulit just run `npm run rebuild` to start the project instead of rebuilding the entire project.
