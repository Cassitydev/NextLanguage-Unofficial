## NextLanguage Unofficial
This is an unofficial branch of NextLanguage, which is maintained
and supported by AshleyAST. This branch has more and better updated
features than the main branch. Which is currently not being updated
at the time being.

NextLangauge is an file reader and loader, which is able to
run Javascript from any file. Including an .txt file and many more.

Now with this unofficial branch of NextLanguage, we're bringing this
to another level, with custom Security Encryption Functions, Github Latest Release
Patch Downloaders, and many more being developed.

Our current [NextLanguage Codebase Docs](https://nxoscloud.github.io/landing) are very detailed and with
many leaks on new upcoming features and engine.
