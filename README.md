## A Custom Programming Language
This programming language was made as a request by Nxoscloud to be used for the Project Next coding language.

## Why?
The Goal for this programming language was for an optimized language engine for Maximum Security and Performance.
Currently we have not reached any of our goals yet, and are working on them heavily.

## Features
Currently this programming language is under heavy development and has not been fully tested. The features currently present are buggy and unstable. We're still working on making this a better language.

Some features are ready such as:
- Functions
- Outputs
- Variables
